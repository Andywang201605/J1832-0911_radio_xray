### Radio Data Analysis

#### Timing - `timing.ipynb`

Code for Extended Data Figure <font color="red">TODO</font>

> raw time of arrivals (`.toa` file) and source timing parameters (`.par` file) are under `data` folder

#### Distance Estimation - `distance_estimation.ipynb`

We used two methods to constrain the distance to the source
- dispersion measure implied distance, with uncertainties estimated based on more precise measurements from `psrcat` for nearby pulsars (see the notebook).
> also see https://apps.datacentral.org.au/pygedm/
- HI absorption line implied lower limit of the distance (see the notebook).
> GMRT data are available in https://naps.ncra.tifr.res.in/goa/data/search, MeerKAT data are avaiable in https://archive.sarao.ac.za/
