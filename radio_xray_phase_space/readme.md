- `data` - folder containing basic information for different kinds of objects such as X-ray flux, radio flux, and distance etc.
- `plot_sources.py` - functions for plotting specific types of objects in the radio-xray phase space (used in the final plotting)
- `radio_xray_phase_space.ipynb` - notebook used for plotting
