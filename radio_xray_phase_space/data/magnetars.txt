# Notes on individual objects:
# PSR J1622-4950: there are at least three different states, one is the discovery in radio
# where the radio pulsations were discovered and X-ray were not. Second is the "normal" magnetar
# state where both X-ray and radio pulsations are discovered and third is quiscenece 
# SGR 1745-2900 Lynch et al (2015) and a few other report the burts and the recovery
# SGR 1935+2154 reported radio + X-ray data for the FRB outbursts (from STARES, FAST) and then
# FAST collaboration reported forest of bursts showing periodic emission
# X-ray flux is in erg/cm^2/s, radio flux density is in mJy, distance is in kpc, upp of 0 is
# detection.
