# The bursts are variable from 5-40 Jy, were observed at 72-231MHz
# and had a spectral index of -1.16, take GM of the energy and BW
# and get flux at 1400 MHz as 1.1 Jy, but this is peak flux.
# The burst duration is 30-60s and the period is 18.18min, so get
# period averaged flux to be 60 mJy.
# Radio flux density is in mJy, X-ray flux is
