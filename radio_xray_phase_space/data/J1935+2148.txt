# The flux densities in the paper are peak flux densities, so
# we need to convert them to period-averaged. For ASKAP, the peak 
# is 119 mJy with a ~min with and 54 min period, so get flux=2.2mJy.
# and for meerKAT the peak is 9 mJy with 0.01% duty cycle, 
# so get flux=9e-4 mJy. X-ray flux is in erg/s and dis in in kpc
