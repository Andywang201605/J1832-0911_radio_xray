#### Constraints on stellar spectral type

Using the mean dwarf stellar colors and absolute magnitudes from Pecaut & Mamajek (2013) (also see https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt), and the $K_s$- and $J$-band limiting magnitudes derived from FourStar and WIRC observations, we estimate the minimum distance constraints for different stellar spectral types.

We considered extinction using two methods (1) using DUSTMAPS from Green (2018) (i.e., `dustmap.bayestar.J1832-0911.npz`); (2) using the extinction measurement for HESS J1832-093 to infer the extinction (see paper for details).
