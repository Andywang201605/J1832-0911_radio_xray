### X-ray related Analysis

This direcotry contains files and codes for X-ray analysis. Some data are exported from other softwares such as Xspec.

#### Chandra Periodicity Search - `chandra_period_search.ipynb`

Code for Extended Data Figure 2. Lomb Scargle periodicity search performed on X-ray photons.

#### X-ray spectral analysis and Comparison against X-ray emitting sources - `xray_spectral_analysis.ipynb`

This notebook contains code for four figures in the Extended Data and Supplementary Information

- C-stat plots for model fitting (Supplementary Figure 3)
- Quiescent X-ray luminosity upper limits for different models (Extended Data Figure 3)
- Quiescent X-ray luminosity vs Age for various types of X-ray bright sources (Extended Data Figure 5)
- Magneto-thermal Evolution plots for NS in (a) P-Pdot space; and (b) Lx-Edot space (Extended Data Figure 4)

Note - exact data used for plotting Extended Data Figure 4 and 5 will be presented in further work (Dehman, Marino, and Rea et al., 2025 in prep) in details
